## 👋 Hey, I’m **Francois**

I am a web developer/designer/instructor at [CICCC](https://www.ciccc.ca/), where I teach and mentor the students in the immersive web development topics. In my spare time, I do a lot of **[ロケハン](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_scouting)** online for photography, planning for trips that usually never happen 😅. I also enjoy learning new technologies!

I've had a decade-long love affair with ⚛️ React.js and all things front-end. 
In application development, my favorite aspect has always been the design process. 
Despite being partially color blind, I possess a natural talent for conceptualization, 
drawing inspiration from traditional fine arts methods.
